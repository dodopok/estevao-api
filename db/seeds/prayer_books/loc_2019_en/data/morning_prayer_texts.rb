  In the tender compassion of our God *
    the dawn from on high shall break upon us,
  To shine on those who dwell in darkness
  and in the shadow of death, *
    and to guide our feet into the way of peace.
  Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; *
    as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
